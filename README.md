🧠 Multi-Class Sentiment Analysis Dataset (240K+ English Comments)
📌 Description
This dataset is a large-scale collection of 241,000+ English-language comments sourced from various online platforms. Each comment is annotated with a sentiment label:

0 — Negative
1 — Neutral
2 — Positive
The Data has been gathered from multiple websites such as :
